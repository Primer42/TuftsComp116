1. What is the disk format of the SD card?
FAT16

2. What type of phone does the suspect have? Please note carrier and operating system with version number. Please elaborate how you determined this information.
Did a grep/keyword search for "htc" (case insensitive)
First hit was an about file, listing model number, and various other statisics.  I've copied the relevant ones below:
"deviceModel":"ADR6300","source":"Verizon","firmwareVersion":"2.3.4"
ADR6300 corresponds to the HTC Droid Incredible
My understanding is that "firmware version" should be the android version, so we're dealing with android 2.3.4
The file was amazonmp3/AMPmetrics_v2.txt

3. What other apps are installed on the phone? Please elaborate how you determined this information.
Based on folders in root direcotry
- espn score center
- amazon mp3

Based on folders in Android/data
- Dropbox
- google voice
- google maps
- youtube
- zynga words with friends


4. List some of the incriminating evidence that you found. Please elaborate where and how you uncovered the evidence.
- Based on the pictures in DCIM/Camera (where the camera saves images by default), he's stalking David Copperfield
- More photos in the truecrypt drive
