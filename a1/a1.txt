3.0 Policy

3.1 Subscrpition Model

Users will be split into two groups, free users and paying users.  Users who do not pay a monthly fee are considered free users, while users who pay a monthly fee set by ShareAll Corp. Inc. will be considered paying users.

A month is defined to be a calendar month, starting at 0:00 EST on the first day of each month and ending at 11:59 EST on the last day of each month.

Any capabilities given to free users are available to paying users, unless otherwise specified.

In order to share a file, a user must specify the other user(s) with which they wish to share each file.  A sharing offer will then be sent to that(those) user(s).  Recieving users may either accept or reject that offer.

3.1.1 Free Users

Free users will be allowed to send or recieve any number of files of any size each month, not exceeding a download limit of 2 GB and upload limit of .5 GB per month.  A file's size is counted against that user's upload limit if they share it with one or more other users - it is not counted multiple times if the user shares it with more than one of their peers.  A file is counted against a users download limit if they accept a share offer from annother user, regardless of how many users the sending user offered the file to.  If sharing or recieving a file exceeds either of the limits, the transaction will not be allowed to occur.
A file is considered to be uploaded or downloaded in a given month if the up/down load was started within that month - if a file finishes uploading or downloading in the next month, it is counted against the first month's  limits and no the second month's.

Free users will also have ad that appear before any share or recieve.

3.1.2 Paying Users

A user who pays has an unlimited upload and download limit for the month for which they pay.  

Paying users will have no ads appear on the site.

3.2 Data Stored by ShareAll Corp. Inc.

Any data will be stored for research purposes only, including but not limited to exploring the sharing practices of users.  This data may also be used to help target ads, though the data about users will not be shared with any company other than ShareAll Corp. Inc.  This data will only be shown internally to employees directly involved with researching the practices of users.

Users will not be able to remove any data that is stored before the 1 (one) year period ends.

Any user may at any time request a record of all stored data regarding them.  ShareAll Corp. Inc. will provide that data with sixty (60) days of the initial request.

- 14 account have passwords
- I used john only
- I found and tried as many wordlists that I could find.  This included the password.lst with john the ripper, an aggrigate free list provied by OpenWall, and all password lists provided in the megasploit framework. I did not attempt brute forcing, as I did not expect that I would have enough time to likely yeild results.
- I was running my computer almost 24 hours a day for about 5 days. So on the order of 120 hours.  2 of those days john was running on the virtual machine, the remaining 3 days were running on the host.  All days were running using all 4 cores of me 2.83 GHz machine.
- Finding batman's, humanhorn's and cmccabe's passwords were easiest (I think - I neglected to record which ones were cracked first).  
- According to /etc/sudoers, only members of the sudo and admin groups have sudo privledges.  According to the members command, defcon is the only member of that group.  Thus, root and defcon are the only administrators.

- which perl
- ifconfig
- ps
- nc [host] [port]
- ls
- file
- cat
- top
- 1) Ping the systems you want the MAC address of
  2) call 'arp -a'
- dig - if you have a hostname, this will allow you to find the IP address of that machine
  Alternatively, nslookup will do a very similar task
  Finally, if you do not have the hostname of the machine you want to reach, you can use nmap to do a ping sweep
  nmap -sP 192.168.1.1-254
  will do a ping sweep of all address on 192.168.1.*
